            <div class="con-con">
                <p>Henan Laboratory of Spatial Information Processing and Engineering was established in 2016. Supported by the innovation resources of Henan university, the laboratory is jointly developed by the Zhengzhou Oriental Sun Network Technology Co. Ltd. (Zhengzhou High & New Technology Industrial Cluster Zone) and Beijing 4D New Century Information Technology Co. Ltd.. The construction system is composed of basic research of engineering (Henan University) and industrial innovation service (Zhengzhou Oriental Sun Network Technology Co. Ltd.).</p>
                <p>The basic research of engineering is established on the foundation of Henan University Key Discipline Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems. The researchers of the lab and other teaching staffs in school of Computer and Information Engineering are responsible for this part. The basic research of engineering aims to carry out innovative and applicative researches in processing and application of remote sensing information, civil aviation meteorological information processing and application and digital city to obtain innovation achievements and independent intellectual property. The laboratory is located in Jinming Campus of Henan university, covering an area of nearly 3500 square meters.</p>
                <p>The industrial innovation service is jointly constructed by Zhengzhou Oriental Sun Network Technology Co. Ltd. and Beijing 4D New Century information Technology Co. Ltd.. it devotes to enhance core competence of the products in high-volume image processing, GPS, urban digitization, automatic control and aims to promote the transformation of the spatial information technology innovation. The industrial innovation service is the extension of the basic research of engineering in industrial cluster area.</p>
                <p>Based on the needs of spatial information technology in the process of economic construction, the laboratory focuses on the study and promotion of its three main research fields. Meanwhile, the lab constructs an industrialization platform of spatial information technology R&D and establishes a distinctive R&D industrial chain with independent intellectual property.</p>
                <p>In recent years, the laboratory has received strong support from Henan University. And it makes cooperation with CAAC, Taiji Group, CAS Institute of Remote sensing, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Public Security Department, Zhengzhou Oriental Sun Network Technology Co. Ltd. and other enterprises or government agencies. It has got financial support with a total of over 20 million yuan and made significant achievements in its three key research fields.</p>
                <p>Approved by CAAC and completed by the laboratory, “MICAPS” (3.2 million R&D fund) has been successfully operated in 48 airports in China. The system covers 7 FIRs in Chinese mainland, involving 31 provinces or municipalities. It relates to the Beijing National Aviation Meteorological Center, 6 regional meteorological services, 37 branches and airport terminals. In December 2009, according to the technical appraisal of the Science and Technology Department of Henan Province, experts agreed that the project has reached international advanced level. Next, we will not only optimize and promote our research achievements to hundreds of regional and military airports, but also make meteorology data-mining and analysis to apply the system to other industries (such as urban meteorology and special regional meteorology) and form several meteorological service products chains.</p>
                <p>“High-Resolution Earth Observation System(CHEOS)” is one of the 16 major projects in 2006—2020 National Medium & Long Term Sci. & Tech. Development Layout. It is constituted by aerospace systems, near space system, aviation system, ground system and application system. As the “departure point” and “foothold”, the application system touches upon precision agriculture, meteorological service and digital city with a total fund of 3 billion yuan. There are 18 organizations participating in the research of application system. Henan University so far has been responsible for 3 sub-projects and 8 subitems. It takes in charge of the algorithm development and system integration. At present, the staged achievements have been checked and well-reputed by relevant authorities.</p>
                <p>Now, the laboratory is developing powerfully and trying to build a public platform of domestic advanced level to support and lead the space information processing and application technology in Henan province and strive to join the ranks of national engineering laboratory.
