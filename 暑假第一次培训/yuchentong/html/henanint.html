                <p>The research center for intelligent technology and applied engineering technology of Henan province was established in 2017. It takes the Henan University as the supporting institution and closely combines the great demand of the economic construction of the country and our province. It regards the development of intelligent technology and application as the main line, and is strengthened with the integrated construction of "production, learning and research". It is an important base for a high level of intelligent technology and application, personnel training, scientific research and applied technology development in our province.</p>
                <p>The researchers of the center mainly come from the "Intelligent Technology and System Laboratory" of the Henan University, the Open Laboratory of Key Disciplines of Henan Higher Schools, the Major Data Research Center of Henan University, as well as the Remote Sensing and Digital Earth Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Henan Costar Group Co. Ltd., Jiangsu Jingchuang Group CO. LTD and Henan Chuang Shi Hua Bao Technology Co., Ltd. It has 50 people related to the research and development of intelligent technology and application products, including remote sensing data processing, computer image processing, car networking, geography and other professional fields. Among them, there are 1 distinguished professors in Henan and 10 professors / researchers. The center covers an area of 1500 square meters, and 600 square meter pilot base which is built with the cooperative companies. It has a high performance computing cluster, a satellite remote sensing information processing system, a deep learning platform, a comprehensive research and development platform for the Internet of cars, with a total of more than 1600 yuan of instrument and equipment.</p>
                <p>This research center focuses on the research of intelligent technology and application. Researchers have studied algorithms for intelligent technology and application software products. They have applied R & D from remote sensing product development, computer vision and image processing, vehicle networking and other industries. In remote sensing information processing technology, with the support of the people's Government of Kaifeng and Henan University, the "Henan Data and Application Center of High Resolution to Earth Observation System" is set up relying on the project center. In computer vision and image processing, researchers are mainly developing computer vision based face recognition, pedestrian detection and tracking related technologies and products. In collaborative technology of the vehicle network, the researchers mainly focus on the technical research and development from two aspects, the layout and optimization of urban electric vehicle charging piles, and the optimization of vehicle active safety and traffic efficiency. In recent years, the research center has been supported by the key projects of the National Natural Science Foundation, the National Science and Technology Major Projects, and the National Science and Technology Supporting Program. It has accumulated more than 80 items including national and provincial projects. It has more than 40 million yuan of scientific research funds, and has won 2 first prize and 2 second prize in science and technology progress in Henan province.</p>
                <p>The research projects currently being carried out include: remote sensing image registration change detection technology, synchronization technology for change detection and image registration, remote sensing image parallel processing technology based on heterogeneous architecture, management and optimization on electric vehicle charging pile space layout, optimization of automotive active safety and traffic efficiency, face recognition and profile analysis system based on deep learning, face recognition system based on ARM, etc.</p>
